We identify a set of requirements in broadcasting messages among a set of trusted peers. Then we propose a scheme for contacts of a peer to obtain broadcast updates of the peer using a pull mechanism where the contacts' identities are maintained anonymous. 
We propose a modification to the hierarchical identity based encryption scheme proposed by Boneh et. al \cite{BBG05} where a peer can request and obtain messages of a common peer from another peer while remaining anonymous. We provide details of an implementation of the cryptographic primitives we propose as a prof of concept. \footnote {This work was done as a part of the coursework of CS 626 : Advanced Information Assurance by Professor Cristina Nita-Rotaru}
