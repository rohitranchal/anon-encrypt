\section{Future Work}

TODO Add comparison with broadcast encryption somewhere\\

Reduce the re-key size\\
\subsection{Size of re-key information}
Currently we generate a minimum amount of information that is required to re-key a peer and its contacts. But in this scheme the re-key informaiton is of order n where n is the number of contacts of the peer. It would be interesting to evaluate the possibility of reducing the size of this public information while maintaining the same properties.

\subsection{Security roof}
We plan to prove that an adversary with polynomially bounded resources will not be able to ...??

\subsection{Implementation of message routing}
The current implementation only covers the cryptographic primitives. It will be interesting to use these with a peer to peer network where the peers are connected only to their private contacts and evaluate the performance. It might be possible to be implemented as a plugin to Freenet \cite{freenet}.
