\section{Conclusion}
We proposed the cryptographic primitives to address the problem of distributing a message from a common peer using a pull mechanism where the peers requesting the message can request messages anonymously. Details of the scheme was provided followed by a high level evaluation of security. As a proof of concept of the proposed cryptographic functionality, we developed an implementation and finally identified the possible future improvements and research related to this work.
