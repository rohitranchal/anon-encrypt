\section{Introduction}
We identify a set of requirements in broadcasting messages among trusted peers using a peer to peer setup. Then we propose a scheme for contacts of a peer to obtain broadcast updates of the peer using a pull mechanism where the contacts' identities are maintained anonymous. 
We propose a modification to the hierarchical identity based encryption scheme proposed by Boneh et. al \cite{BBG05} where a peer can request messages of a common peer from another peer while remaining anonymous.

Following section introduces the setup of the network of peers and how they are connected and the requirements that we try to satisfy with our scheme. This is followed by the preliminary notions and then we describe our solution that meets the stated requirements. Implementation of the proposed cryptographic primitives is presented in section V followed by future directions of this work and conclusion.
